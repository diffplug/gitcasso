Special thanks to:
- [overtype](https://overtype.dev/) for doing `textarea` syntax highlighting of `md`
- [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) for the broad library of syntax highlighters
- [Yukai Huang](https://github.com/Yukaii) for [the PRs](https://github.com/panphora/overtype/issues?q=is%3Apr+author%3AYukaii) which made the two work together
